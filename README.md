# Error Handler (RCONSOLE/FILE)
Inspiration from [GTA SA Crash Handler](https://www.gtainside.com/en/sanandreas/other/116027-gta-sa-crash-handler-asi-plugin/)

## Troubleshooting
If your executor doesn't support RCONSOLE it will:
#### Print it in Roblox's Developer Console (OPTIONAL)
- This is optional since some games detect what is being printed.
If you get kicked by simply executing, I suggest putting it into your AutoExecute Folder.

`If your executor is still not supported then contact me.`

## Installation Process
- You would be needing an executor for this to work.
- Simply click [me](https://github.com/Empire4946/error-catcherRCONSOLE/releases) to see the script.

## Requirements (Optional)
- [x] Executors that atleast support RCONSOLE
- ErrorHandler mostly use RCONSOLE.
- [x] Executors that atleast support writefile
- Without this then you can not use this script.
